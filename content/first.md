# Permission: The Birth Story
##(or how this blog came to be)

Today, Monday, is the first day of an experiment that was born last Friday during a conversation with my friend, Tree. 

####No Time for Friendship

I had told her that I was feeling unsure about how much she wanted to be friends with me, because most times we saw each other, I made the trip to her house with the baby and paraphernalia in tow - kind of a shlep, but worth it, I felt, to see someone I really liked. 

The problem was, she didn’t make much of an effort to hang out with me. Like, it was nice if I came, but if I didn’t, and we didn’t see each other, that would have been OK too. 

Tree thought for a while, and said, “My husband and I are stretched so thin right now. I just don’t have time or energy to make plans with you. I’m so sorry.” Turns out, she had made a commitment to a religious organization that was taking a lot of her time. You could tell - and she admitted it - that she was not very excited about it. It was an obligation that she should have wanted to do, but didn’t. 

####Time Flies

Which begs the question: Where does our time go? I had done a time-management exercise that very week to find out.  Here are the results:

**What do you mostly spend your time on?**

Work
Cleaning
Baby

**What would you like to spend your time on?**

Exercise
Creative Projects (photo albums, scrapbooking, etc.)
Cooking Blog
Learning about Coaching
Baby

Yes, you saw that right. The only thing I do that I want to do is spend time with my baby. The rest is obligation.

####Obligation

Which got me thinking about obligation. (booo!) Tree said, that she should take the initiative and make plans with me if not doing it was going to make me sad. “No!” I said. “Please don’t do that. How would you feel if someone hung out with you because they should, not because they wanted to?”

We can approach tasks from a place of love or a place of fear. Hanging out with me because you have to? Fear that I’ll be mad at you. Doing sucky tasks because you want the greater good they are a part of? That’s love (aka changing dirty diapers).

I said, how about, whenever you really want to, you call me up and make plans.  If that day never comes, all that means is that I wasn’t a priority - other things were more important. And that is OK, because that is what is. I told Tree I wasn’t the sort of person who would hate her for that. I would accept it, the way you have to accept it if a person ‘just isn’t into you’. It’s not personal. It just is. 

Tree was like, “Who ARE? you?”! She was wowed that now, she had no pressure to ‘perform’ for me as a friend. I think she liked that. 

####A Mistake’s An Opportunity

Being a parent has made me more forgiving with myself, and more forgiving with others. I don’t want my daughter to think she can’t ever make mistakes. Life and learning are made with mistakes, and if we are to live and learn, we have to be OK with them. Better to love yourself (and others) than to be perfect.

My grandfather wrote a song about this:

**A Mistake’s An Opportunity**

So Tree turned the tables on me. She said, “Why don’t you do what you want to do with your time?” She was talking about my work time. I’ve been trying to work on my company for the longest and things have not really taken off. Every week is like the one before. I spend my time thinking about the things I should do but don’t because I don’t want to, but feeling too guilty to do something I want to do. Like, how can I bake cookies instead of working on my company? I’ll bake cookies once I have a successful company! Translation: I will never have time to bake cookies or work on my baby’s photo album. And it’s true: I don’t. 

So, Tree gave me Permission. She said, if it helps, I give you permission to not work on your company and do whatever you want to do during your work time. And then she added, “If you wrote a Mommy Blog, I would read it.”

That was Friday. Today is Monday. And I’m gonna do it. Here we are. First blog post. (I’ve started a few blogs over the years but never got past the second post.) Maybe this time will be different. Now I have a reason. A mission. Per Mission. 

I told my mentor about the blog:

Had a germ of an idea to call my blog 'Permission". Permission to be who you are. And on the blog I would share my journey of being who I am and inspire others to do the same. It would be a blog about not being perfect and about sometimes achieving more than I thought I could. I would share my mom's emails to make people laugh. (they are great). I would share my best recipes. I would share me and Tanguy's trials and tribulations of parenting and marriage.

So that’s it. This blog is a space for me to share everything I am giving myself permission to do, and a place to inspire you to do the same.
